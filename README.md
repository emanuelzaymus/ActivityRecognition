# ActivityRecognition

## About
This work studies usability of SVMs (Support Vector Machines) on *(Everyday Life) Human Activity Recognition Problem* in smart-homes.

I did this work while my erasmus internship in *Polytechnic University of Valencia* [(Universitat Politècnica de València)](http://www.upv.es/) located in Valencia (Spain).
This research was done in *[School of Informatics](https://www.inf.upv.es/www/etsinf/es/)* in collaboration with teacher [Eva Onaindia de la Rivaherrera](http://www.upv.es/ficha-personal/onaindia) and student Carlos Güemes Palau as a part of Carlos's [bachelor thesis](https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/150522).

## Support Vectore Machines
[SVMs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#) are a set of supervised learning methods effective in high dimensional spaces and in such cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

## Data
Used datasets are called **[CASAS Datasets](http://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/)** and were collected from smart-homes equipped with several motion-sensors, gas-sensors, water-sensors, door sensors etc.

## Results
We were able to achieve accuracy as high as **97.0% - 98.8%** based on the dataset.
More about the results [here](https://github.com/emanuelzaymus/ActivityRecognition/tree/master/result-reports).

## Technologies
- Python
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#)
